# Demo 4: Terraform State Management and Configuration Drift Detection
# Example terraform.tfvars file - copy to terraform.tfvars and customize

# Resource group name - MUST match what GitHub Actions expects
resource_group_name = "rg-mms-demo4-state"

# Azure region for all resources
location = "East US"

# Virtual machine configuration
vm_name = "vm-demo4-drift"
vm_size = "Standard_B2s"

# VM Administrator credentials
# IMPORTANT: These will be stored in Terraform state!
admin_username = "demoadmin"
admin_password = "P@ssw0rd123!Demo"

# DRIFT DEMONSTRATION NOTES:
# 1. The NSG will have two rules for drift testing:
#    - RDP rule with source "10.0.0.0/8" (change to "*" for drift)
#    - HTTP rule on port 80 (delete entirely for drift)
#
# 2. Run 'terraform plan' after manual changes to see drift
#
# 3. Run 'terraform apply' to correct the drift
#
# 4. State contains sensitive data - shows why remote state security matters
